# 3D Matrix Visualizer
Visualize matrices.

Play with it at: https://alessandrotambellini.github.io/3d-matrix-visualizer/  
Instead, to run it locally, start a simple server like `py -m http.server 3000` and open `index.html` in a browser.

Note: the `three` files are copy pasted from the three.js package. The only customization is the import path of `OrbitControls.js` that is modified from `three` to `./three.core.min.js`.
